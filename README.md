### Goals
- __Experince Sharing:__ This is being done in two ways - Case studies and portfolios. Case studies will be in-depth views into my process, decision making and critical thinking. Portfolios will showcase the final piece of work and will emphasize more on the visual aspect of it rather than behind the scenes
- __Thoughts and ideas:__ Will be shared in the form of articles, short how-to guides and blog posts.
- __Intro about me:__ To communicate who am I as a human being, what makes me excited and what cool projects I am involved in at present.
- __Ways to contact__: Different channels to communicate through, in case if anybody wants to reach out to me.
- __Activity:__ What I am doing on other platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn etc.
